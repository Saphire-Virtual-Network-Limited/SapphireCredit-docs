## Error Handling Best Practices

- **4xx Client Errors**: Check your request payloads, authentication tokens, and route parameters.
- **5xx Server Errors**: These are rare. If you encounter one, retry after a short delay or report it to support.
- **Use Retry Logic**: For `429`, `502`, and `503` responses, implement exponential backoff retry strategies.
- **Log Everything**: Always log errors with their `statusCode`, `message`, and `timestamp` for easier debugging.
