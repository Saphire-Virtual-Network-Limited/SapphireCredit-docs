At **Sapphire Credit**, our mission is to empower individuals and businesses in emerging markets by providing fast, accessible, and reliable credit solutions — from **device financing** to **personal and business loans**.

We remove the traditional barriers to credit with a platform built for **speed, simplicity, and security**. Whether you're financing a new device or accessing working capital, Sapphire Credit helps you move forward — with confidence.

## What You Can Build

Use our APIs to:

- Apply for and manage **device financing**
- Process **loan applications** and check eligibility
- Handle **repayments and schedules**
- Access **real-time customer credit status**
- Integrate **identity verification & scoring tools**

## Why Use Sapphire Credit’s API?

- **Fast Approvals**: Minimal delay between request and decision
- **Developer Friendly**: Clear API structure with RESTful endpoints
- **Secure by Default**: We follow best-in-class authentication and data security practices
- **Built to Scale**: Our APIs are designed for both startups and large-scale platforms

## SDKs and Libraries

We offer SDKs and packages to get you started quickly:

- Node.js SDK (coming soon)
- Sapphire Credit CLI (coming soon)
- Postman Collections
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs

You can explore the API directly or use these tools to simplify integration.

## Environments

We offer both `test` and `live` environments:

- **Test Environment**: Simulate requests with test keys (no real data or charges)
- **Live Environment**: Fully functional with real customers, devices, and disbursements

Switching environments is as easy as changing your API keys.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled using **API keys**, which come in three levels:

- **App Key** – Used internally within Sapphire projects
- **Public Key** – Safe for client-side use, with limited privileges
- **Secret Key** – Full-access key for backend use only (keep this secure)

Visit the [API Keys](/apikeys) section for full details.
