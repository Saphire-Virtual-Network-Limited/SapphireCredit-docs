The BVN Liveness Checker is designed to validate a customer's BVN (Bank Verification Number) and confirm their identity with an additional check against their date of birth (DOB). This process is a core part of Sapphire Credit’s onboarding and compliance flow.

### Overview

The checker accepts the following parameters:

- `bvn` — Bank Verification Number
- `dob` — Date of Birth

The process follows a multi-step logic to ensure accuracy, performance, and security.

## Verification Flow

### Step 1: Instant Record Lookup

If Sapphire Credit already has a recent record of the BVN:

- A verified response is returned immediately.
- No additional verification is performed.
- This helps speed up verification for repeat users.

### Step 2: Direct Verification

If the BVN has not been verified recently, Sapphire Credit will contact an identity validation partner to perform live verification.

#### Response Code: `00` – _BVN Found and Valid_

- Sapphire Credit checks if the provided DOB matches the date of birth associated with the BVN.
  - ✅ **If DOB matches**:
    - A successful response is returned.
    - The result is stored securely for future requests.
  - ❌ **If DOB does not match**:
    - The process is halted.
    - Sapphire Credit’s verification, admin, and developer teams are notified.
    - The mismatch is logged for investigation.

#### Response Code: `01` – _Invalid BVN_

- The BVN is incorrect or does not exist.
- An alert is sent to Sapphire Credit’s developer and verification teams.
- The process is terminated without further action.

#### Response Code: `02` – _Service Unavailable_

- Sapphire Credit's verification partner is temporarily down.
- The developer and admin teams are notified immediately.
- The system switches to an alternative verification route.

#### Response Code: `03` – _Insufficient Funds for Verification_

- The verification partner is unable to process the request due to low balance.
- Sapphire Credit’s admin, developer, and finance teams are alerted.
- An automatic switch to an alternative verification route is triggered.

## Alerts and Monitoring

All alerts are routed to the appropriate internal teams with detailed information, including:

- User context
- Input BVN and DOB
- Response details
- Timestamp of the event

## Data Handling

- Sensitive identity data is securely stored and managed in accordance with local regulations.
- Previously verified identities are stored only as long as necessary and refreshed periodically to ensure accuracy.
