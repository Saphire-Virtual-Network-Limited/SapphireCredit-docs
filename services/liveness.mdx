The BVN Liveness Checker is designed to validate a customer's BVN (Bank Verification Number) and confirm their identity with an additional check against their date of birth (DOB). This process is a core part of Sapphire Credit’s onboarding and compliance flow.

### Overview

The checker accepts the following parameters:

- `bvn` — Bank Verification Number
- `dob` — Date of Birth

### BVN Input Validation

The **`bvn`** (Bank Verification Number) should be a valid 11-digit number. This number is used for identity verification and must match the following pattern:

- **Pattern**: 11 digits (`\d{11}`)

If the BVN does not conform to this pattern, the request will be rejected with an error.

### DOB Input Validation

The **`dob`** (Date of Birth) can be entered in various formats. The system checks the provided `dob` against multiple common date formats to ensure flexibility. The following formats are supported:

- `dd-MM-yyyy`
- `MM-dd-yyyy`
- `yyyy-dd-MM`
- `yyyy-MM-dd`
- `dd/MM/yyyy`
- `MM/dd/yyyy`
- `yyyy/MM/dd`
- `yyyy.MM.dd`
- `dd MMM yyyy`
- `dd-MMM-yyyy`

### Multi-Step Validation Process

1. **Step 1: BVN Validation**

   - The `bvn` is checked for validity using the regular expression for 11 digits.
   - If the `bvn` is invalid, an error message is returned: `Invalid BVN`.

2. **Step 2: DOB Validation**

   - The `dob` is checked against each of the supported formats.
   - If the `dob` does not match any of the allowed formats, an error message is returned: `Invalid Date of Birth`.

3. **Step 3: Successful Validation**
   - If both the `bvn` and `dob` are valid, a success message is returned indicating that the validation was successful.

### Example

For a given request:

- **BVN**: `12345678901` (Valid 11-digit number)
- **DOB**: `25-12-1990` (Valid date in `dd-MM-yyyy` format)

If both parameters pass the validation checks, the response will indicate success.

If either parameter fails validation, an appropriate error message will be returned.

### Getting started

To get started, you can use the [BVN Liveness Checker](/api-reference/endpoint/bvn-check) endpoint.

### Step 1: Instant Record Lookup

If Sapphire Credit already has a recent record of the BVN:

- A verified response is returned immediately.
- No additional verification is performed.
- This helps speed up verification for repeat users.

### Step 2: Direct Verification

If the BVN has not been verified recently, Sapphire Credit will contact an identity validation partner to perform live verification.

#### Response Code: `00` – _BVN Found and Valid_

- Sapphire Credit checks if the provided DOB matches the date of birth associated with the BVN.
  - ✅ **If DOB matches**:
    - A successful response is returned.
    - The result is stored securely for future requests.
  - ❌ **If DOB does not match**:
    - The process is halted.
    - Sapphire Credit’s verification, admin, and developer teams are notified.
    - The mismatch is logged for investigation.

#### Response Code: `01` – _Invalid BVN_

- The BVN is incorrect or does not exist.
- An alert is sent to Sapphire Credit’s developer and verification teams.
- The process is terminated without further action.

#### Response Code: `02` – _Service Unavailable_

- Sapphire Credit's verification partner is temporarily down.
- The developer and admin teams are notified immediately.
- The system switches to an alternative verification route.

#### Response Code: `03` – _Insufficient Funds for Verification_

- The verification partner is unable to process the request due to low balance.
- Sapphire Credit’s admin, developer, and finance teams are alerted.
- An automatic switch to an alternative verification route is triggered.

## Alerts and Monitoring

All alerts are routed to the appropriate internal teams with detailed information, including:

- User context
- Input BVN and DOB
- Response details
- Timestamp of the event

Appropriate channels are also notified of the event on WhatsApp and Slack for prompt actions.

## Quick Summary

1. Firstly, the bvn is hashed using argon2id to ensure that the data is not exposed.
2. Secondly, the bvn is verified against the cache db to check if it has been verified recently.
3. If the bvn has been verified recently, the process is terminated and a verified response is returned immediately.
4. If the bvn has not been verified recently, Sapphire Credit will contact an identity validation partner to perform live verification.
