## API Keys

API keys are essential for secure communication between your application and Sapphire Creditâ€™s services.
They authenticate requests, ensuring that only authorized applications can access your Sapphire Credit account and perform actions.
Sapphire Credit provides two types of API keys to cater to different needs: Public Keys and Secret Keys.

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

"api": {
		"mdx": {
			"server": "https://connect.sapphirecredits.com/v1",
			"auth": {
				"method": "key",
				"name": "x-app-key"
			}
		},
		"playground": {
			"display": "interactive"
		}
	},
