The Credit History Check service is designed to validate a customer's credit history and confirm their credit worthiness.

### Overview

The checker accepts the following parameters:

- `bvn` â€” Bank Verification Number

## Quick Summary

1. Firstly, the bvn is hashed using argon2id to ensure that the data is not exposed.
2. Secondly, the bvn is verified against the cache to check if it has been verified recently.
3. If the bvn has been verified recently, the process is terminated and a verified response is returned immediately.
4. If the bvn has not been verified recently, Sapphire Credit will contact an credit validation partner to perform live verification.
