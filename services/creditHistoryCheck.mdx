<Warning>This service is only available to users with an **App Key**. You must provide a valid **App Key** in the authorization headers before you can use this service. For more details, please see the [Api Keys page](/apikeys#1-app-key).</Warning>

The Credit History Check service is designed to validate a customer's credit history and confirm their credit worthiness.

### Overview

The checker accepts the following parameters:

- `bvn` — Bank Verification Number

### BVN Input Validation

The **`bvn`** (Bank Verification Number) should be a valid 11-digit number. This number is used for identity verification and must match the following pattern:

- **Pattern**: 11 digits (`\d{11}`)

If the BVN does not conform to this pattern, the request will be rejected with an error.

### Getting started

To get started, you can use the [Credit History Check](/api-reference/endpoint/credit-check) endpoint.

# Loan Evaluation – Overview

This system helps determine whether a user’s loan application should be **approved** or **declined** based on their financial history.

It uses two main processes:

- **Loan History Retrieval**
- **Loan History Evaluation**

## Step 1: Loan History Retrieval

Before evaluating an application, the system first tries to fetch the user’s loan history using their BVN (Bank Verification Number).

### Here's how it works:

- It checks if loan history is already stored in the system (cached).
- If found, it uses that data immediately to speed things up.
- If not found, it retrieves the loan history from an external service.
- If the history indicates **issues**, it sends an alert to the relevant teams and stops the process.
- If the history is **acceptable**, it saves it in the system for future use (for up to 3 days).

## Step 2: Loan History Evaluation

Once the system has the loan history, it evaluates each loan record to decide if the application should be approved.

### Here's what the system looks for:

- **No loan history at all** → The application is automatically approved.
- **Too many existing loans (more than 5)** → The application is declined.
- **Individual loan checks**:
  - Performing loans with no arrears → ✅ Accepted
  - Minor arrears (1–30 days), marked as “pass and watch” → ✅ Accepted
  - Substandard loans with minor overdue amounts → ✅ Accepted
  - Doubtful loans with moderate arrears → ✅ Accepted
  - Lost loans with over 90 days in arrears → ❌ Rejected
  - Anything else → ✅ Accepted by default

## Final Decision

After reviewing all loans:

- If **60% or more** of the loans are acceptable → **The application is approved**.
- If **less than 60%** are acceptable → **The application is declined**.

## Quick Summary

1. **Retrieve** the user’s loan history using their BVN.
2. **Evaluate** each loan based on a set of rules.
3. **Decide**:
   - If most loans are okay → The user is approved.
   - If many loans are problematic → The user is declined.
4. **Notify** relevant teams if there's a rejection.
5. **Cache** the result for next time.

This flow ensures users are fairly evaluated based on their financial behavior while also optimizing speed and performance by reusing cached data.
