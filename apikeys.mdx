API keys are essential for secure communication between custom application, services or product and Sapphire Credit’s services.
They authenticate requests, ensuring that only authorized applications can access Sapphire Credit APis and perform actions.
Sapphire Credit provides two types of API keys to cater to different needs: Public Keys and Secret Keys.

### 1. **App Key**

The **App Key** is used for identifying and authorizing internal applications within the Sapphire Credit ecosystem. It is typically assigned to specific app-level projects and is used for internal tracking, usage reporting, and scoped access control.

<Warning>Make sure to store your App Key in a secure location. It cannot be retrieved once generated, unless updated.</Warning>

### Key & Modes

- There is **no test or live mode** — this key is static and environment-agnostic
- Used in **internal applications and projects**.
- Should be included in **server-to-server communications**.
- Not meant for public exposure.
- Can be rotated or deactivated from the dashboard.

<Note>Product Names must be unique. Duplicate product names will be rejected.</Note>

#### Creating a product App Key

To obtain your App Key, follow these steps:

1. Login to your Sapphire Credit dashboard.
2. Ensure that you are **registered/invited** as an **Internal Developer** of Sapphire Credit.
3. Click on the **Products** on the sidebar menu of your dashboard.
4. Click on **Create New Product**.
5. Type in the product name and description.
6. Click on **Create Product**.
7. Copy the App Key and save it in a secure location.

<Warning>Exercise caution when updating a product's App Key. Updating it will invalidate the previous key, requiring you to update your application with the new key. Please note, your username will be logged to track any updates.</Warning>

#### Updating a product App Key

To update your App Key, follow these steps:

1. Login to your Sapphire Credit dashboard.
2. Ensure that you are **registered/invited** as an **Internal Developer** of Sapphire Credit.
3. Click on the **Products** on the sidebar menu of your dashboard.
4. Click on the **product** you want to update.
5. Click on **Generate New Key**.
6. Copy the App Key and save it in a secure location.

#### Deleting a product App Key

To delete your App Key, follow these steps:

1. Login to your Sapphire Credit dashboard.
2. Ensure that you are **registered/invited** as an **Internal Developer** of Sapphire Credit.
3. Click on the **Products** on the sidebar menu of your dashboard.
4. Click on the **product** you want to delete.
5. Click on **Delete Product**.
6. Confirm Yes or No

### 2. **Public API Key**

The **Public Key** is a non-sensitive identifier used on the **client-side** (browser, mobile app) of your application. While it can initiate certain operations (like starting a transaction), it has **read-only or limited-write** capabilities and cannot access sensitive information or modify core account settings.

- Safe for client-side environments.
- Cannot modify account or access sensitive data.
- Use for initializing public-facing interactions.

---

### 3. **Secret API Key**

The **Secret Key** is a highly sensitive credential that grants **full access** to your account’s API operations, including financial data, identity actions, and account modifications.

- Must only be used in **backend** or **secure server environments**.
- Never expose in frontend or public codebases.
- Treat like a password — if exposed or compromised, **regenerate immediately**.
- Allows full access to all API operations, including write actions and sensitive queries.

> You can manage, rotate, or revoke all your keys securely in the [Sapphire Credit Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.sapphirecredits.com).
